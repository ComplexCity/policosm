improvements
============

future features include
* filter network and remove edge with certain attributes or values
* perform KDE on any attribute or value
* implement special distance with KDE
* finish network display with chosen attribute
* compute basic stats on the graph (degree distribution, edge distribution, shortest path, etc.)
* add centrality measures
* add time travel function (time travel distance based on levels on osm) 
* create a simpler graph, no attributes ! -> coonectivity measures ? 
* add complex measures
	* average streets per node
	* proportion of streets per node
	* average street length
	* node/intersection, edge/street density
	* average circuity
	* diameter/periphery, radius/center
	* node/edge connectivity
	* average node connectivity
	* clustering coefficient
	* average clustering coefficient betweenness centrality
	* average betweenness centrality closeness centrality
	* average closeness centrality PageRank
	* multiple centrality assessment
	* space syntax


add graphlets
